### Fees
#### Kart Rental
| Model    | Morning | Afternoon | Full Day | Note                           |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|
| N35/T4   | ¥10,000 | ¥12,000   | ¥20,000  | Beginners only N35             |
| KT100SEC | ¥15,000 | ¥16,500   | ¥26,000  | A license required or owner's permission |

- Time depends on the circuit schedule for that day, generally, morning is 09:00-11:00 or 09:00-11:30
- If there are many participants, there may be divided classes (usually 20-minute intervals), so you may not be able to run full
    - Afternoons are busier, and there are days with 3 divided classes (2024-03-30)
- One machine can be shared. However, ¥2,500 per sub-driver
- Reservation required (the day before)

- Not listed on the website: There are records of N32/T4 being ¥8,000 on Customer Appreciation Day

##### Examples of Class Division
Depending on the congestion, the available time can vary considerably. In my experience, afternoons tend to be busier than mornings.
Also, since there are usually no other beginner groups in the morning, there is a high chance that everyone will be in the beginner class together.

- Morning 09:00-11:30, 2 classes (Beginner, Expert): 20-minute intervals until 11:10, then 10-minute intervals, effectively about 01:20.
- Afternoon 13:00-16:30, 3 classes (Beginner, Junior, Expert): 20-minute intervals until 16:00, then 10-minute intervals, effectively about 01:10.

Practice 7 minutes, Qualifying 7 minutes, Final 10 Laps, Award Ceremony

¥7,700 per person (¥6,600 on weekdays)

- Reservation required (3 days in advance)
- From 4 people to a maximum of 10 people
- Machine: N35

#### License
Reservation required, Training, ¥1,650, 2 photos of 4x3cm required (temporary license issued if forgotten)

#### Other Required Items
- Racing Suit Rental ¥2,200

- Anti-slip Gloves (Racing Gloves) Purchase ¥400

### Notes
- Please wear shoes that can get dirty when stepping on the pedals
- While there have been no major injuries in previous events, it goes without saying that you won't be sued if you get injured. Please note that they will have you sign a paper to this effect. Also, it's a good circuit that takes measures such as separating experienced drivers from beginners, so there aren't many accidents.
